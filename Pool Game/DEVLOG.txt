  - Decided to make a pool game.
  - Designed the game in scratch paper. 
 	- Four bars at the edges of screen to block the balls.
 	- Six pockets in different places of bars.
 	- Green background.
	- White cue ball.
	- Six colorful balls.
  - Design game mechanics:
	- Drag and shoot the cue ball to hit colorful balls into pockets to earn points.
	- Each drag is a round.
	- Player win the game when all balls into pocket.
  - Design game aesthetic goals:
	- Competiton: Player wants to win the game in as little time as possible.
	- Drama: To win the game in a minimum time, players wants to move fast. But the fast the ball moves, the more
		likely the colorful balls be hit to a uncontrolled direction, which consumes more time to win the game.
