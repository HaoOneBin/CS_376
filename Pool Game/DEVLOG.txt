  - Decided to make a pool game.
  - Designed the game in scratch paper. 
 	- Four bars at the edges of screen to block the balls.
 	- Six pockets in different places of bars.
 	- Green background.
	- White cue ball.
	- Six colorful balls.
  - Design game mechanics:
	- Drag and shoot the cue ball to hit colorful balls into pockets to earn points.
	- Each drag is a round.
	- Player win the game when all balls into pocket.
	- Core loop:
		Locate colorful balls, move white balls to hit colorful balls into pockets.
  - Design game aesthetic goals:
	- Competition: 
		Definition:
			Player wants to win the game in as little time as possible.
		Success:
			Players want to win. 
		Failure:
			Player feel that they cannot win.
			Player cannot measure their progress.	
	- Drama: 
		Definition:
			Its central conflict creates dramatic tension.
		Success:
			A sense of uncertainty.
			A sense of inevitability
		Failure:
			The conflictâ€™s outcome is obvious (no uncertainty)
			No sense of forward progress (no inevitability)

	- Implement the game design idea.
	- Implement the game mechanics.

	- Found a bug that when ball moves too fast, collision will not happen.
	- Tired to fixed the bug by limiting the maximum force added to the ball to reduces its speed.

5:00PM Nov 13 2021
	- Failed to fix the bug after two hours.
	- Decided changed the mechanics to move the ball to hit colorful balls.

6:00PM Nov 13 2021
	- Added a timer and result game scene.
	- Added game sound.

7:00PM Nov 13 2021 - After-action report
	What I originally set out to do:
		With aesthetic goals(competition and drama goals), make a pool game that drag and shot 
		the cue ball to hit other balls into pockets to earn points.
	Summarize what my goals ended up being by the end
		With aesthetic goals(competition and drama goals), made a pool game that move the cue 
		ball to hit other balls into pockets to earn points.
	Summarize what you accomplished of those goals
		Successfully made a pool game with green table and white ball hitting colorful balls into 
		pockets to earn points.
		Successfully fulfill the competition goal: Player wants to win the game in as little time 
		as possible and can feel making progress because they can see the number of colorful balls 
		is when hitting pocket.
		Successfully fulfill the drama goal: To win the game in a minimum time, players wants 
		to move fast. However, due to the uncertainty of movement of colorful balls, the fast the 
		white ball moves, the more likely the colorful balls hit to an uncontrolled direction, 
		which consumes more time to win the game. Thus, inevitably, players would have to slow down
		to move precisely.			
	What went right?
		Successfully implement the design and most of mechanics.
	What went wrong?
		Failed to implement drag and shot because of a bug.
	What do you wish you knew at the start of the project that you know now?
		Change the mechanics when get struggled for a bug for hours instead of getting deeper into it.
	What did you learn in the process?
		When object velocity is too high, there is a bug that it will go through another object instead of collision.
